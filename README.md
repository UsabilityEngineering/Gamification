# Gamification

Sometimes learning can be dull and boring; reading textbooks can put people to sleep. One solution to this is gamification, the idea of adding game elements to learning environments to keep students intrigue. The purpose of this project is to create a software that implements this idea and hopefully boosts students engagement in learning.
